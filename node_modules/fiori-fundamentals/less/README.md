# LESS compatible Fiori Fundamentals

Please note that this is NOT a full port of the library to LESS. We are providing only select files that can be used in a LESS environment. For example, some `calc` functions are escaped to avoid errors when the library is processed as LESS.

> NOTE: The `fonts` and `icons` are not included as part of this file. You will need to bring the regular `dist` versions of those files into your project separately.

We are offering these files to ease the transition for some teams that are migrating their UI to a new look and feel but who are not in a position to adopt a SASS workflow.

We welcome ideas and contributions to build this out if there is a strong need.
